# AML-Transaction-Monitoring-Project
This project simulates a real-world Anti-Money Laundering (AML) transaction monitoring process used by banks and financial institutions. Transactions are analyzed using rule-based AML red flags to identify alerts and suspicious activities. The project includes transaction analysis, risk classification, and investigation case summaries

## Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world Anti-Money Laundering (AML) transaction monitoring process used by banks and financial institutions. The objective is to identify suspicious financial activities using rule-based AML red flags and perform basic investigation and risk assessment.

## Objective
- Analyze customer transaction data  
- Apply AML red-flag rules used in banking  
- Identify alerts and suspicious transactions  
- Document investigation findings and recommendations  

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- **data/** – Contains sample transaction data in CSV format  
- **analysis/** – Excel-based AML transaction analysis and risk classification  
- **documentation/** – Detailed AML transaction monitoring project report (PDF)  
- **investigation_notes/** – Suspicious activity case investigation summaries  
- **README.md** – Project overview and explanation  

## AML Red-Flag Rules Applied
- Large cash transactions above regulatory thresholds  
- Structuring (multiple transactions just below reporting limits)  
- Transactions involving high-risk countries  
- Sudden increase in transaction value or frequency  
- Large business transactions without clear justification  

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Microsoft Excel  
- CSV datasets  
- AML / KYC regulatory concepts  
- FATF and AML compliance guidelines  

## Key Outcomes
- Identified and classified suspicious transactions  
- Assigned risk levels (Low / Medium / High)
